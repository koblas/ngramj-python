This is a port of the NGramJ library (technically the CNgram portion) library http://ngramj.sourceforge.net/ to python.  This was 
motivated out of the need for a decent language identification library and finding most of the python implementations lacking.

For the moment, the quick start is in ngramj/run -- give it a test as:
    
    python -m ngramj.run FILENAME
